    "# Explicit feedback movie recommendations\n",
    "In this example, we'll build a quick explicit feedback recommender system: that is, a model that takes into account explicit feedback signals (like ratings) to recommend new content.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use an approach first made popular by the [Netflix prize](http://www.netflixprize.com/) contest: [matrix factorization](https://datajobs.com/data-science-repo/Recommender-Systems-[Netflix].pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is very simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with user-item-rating triplets, conveying the information that user _i_ gave some item _j_ rating _r_.\n",
    "2. Represent both users and items as high-dimensional vectors of numbers. For example, a user could be represented by `[0.3, -1.2, 0.5]` and an item by `[1.0, -0.3, -0.6]`.\n",
    "3. The representations should be chosen so that, when we multiplied together (via [dot products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product)), we can recover the original ratings.\n",
    "4. The utility of the model then is derived from the fact that if we multiply the user vector of a user with the item vector of some item they _have not_ rated, we hope to obtain a predicition for the rating they would have given to it had they seen it.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Spotlight fits models such as these using [stochastic gradient descent](http://cs231n.github.io/optimization-1/). The procedure goes roughly as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with representing users and items by randomly chosen vectors. Because they are random, they are not going to give useful recommendations, but we are going to improve them as we fit the model.\n",
    "2. Go through the (user, item, rating) triplets in the dataset. For every triplet, compute the rating that the model predicts by multiplying the user and item vectors together, and compare the result with the actual rating: the closer they are, the better the model.\n",
    "3. If the predicted rating is too low, adjust the user and item vectors (by a small amount) to increase the prediction.\n",
    "4. If the predicted rating is too high, adjust the vectors to decrease it.\n",
    "5. Continue iterating over the training triplets until the model's accuracy stabilizes.\n",

    "This is a fairly simple model, and can be extended by adding side-information, adding more non-linear layers, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before plunging into such extensions, it is worth knowing that models using explicit ratings have fallen out of favour both in [academia](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8e8e/cc4591f6d919f6ad247e7ef3300de2fed7a3.pdf)  and in [industry](https://media.netflix.com/en/company-blog/goodbye-stars-hello-thumbs). It is now widely accepted that _what_ people choose to interact with is more meaningful than how they rate the interactions they have.\n",
    "\n",
    "These scenarios are called _implicit feedback_ settings. If you're interested in building these models, have a look at Spotlight's [implicit factorization](https://maciejkula.github.io/spotlight/factorization/implicit.html) models, as well as the [implicit sequence models](https://maciejkula.github.io/spotlight/sequence/representations.html) which aim to explicitly model the sequential nature of interaction data."
